I wanted to look at the quality of Google's first page of search results, using search operators to exclude AI-written articles and remove Google's AI Summary. I used the search operators `before:` and `-ai`.

ChatGPT launched in 2022, so by using `before:` we can filter out results published before then. This will exclude newer articles that might be AI-written. To remove the AI Overview that now appears at the top of search results, we use `-ai`.

The idea came from this video:

Going through and using the search operators, we can see that the link for <https://www.khronos.org/Gltf>, which is the organization behind glTF, isn't on the first page of Google results. It only appears after using the `-ai` search operator to remove the AI Summary.

If we highlight any links from khronos.org, we get links to <https://www.khronos.org/files/gltf20-reference-guide.pdf> for our `before:2018 -ai` search, and links to <https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html> for our `before:2022 -ai` and `before:2023 -ai` searches.

The featured snippet also doesn't use the direct source <https://www.khronos.org/glTF>, unless we search `before:2018 -ai` or earlier years.

ChatGPT-written articles have pushed out the actually useful results, and now Google is using those poorly written AI articles as sources for its AI Overview.
